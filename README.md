# Shop Game

## Author: Michael Johnson

### Overview

Welcome to **Shop Game**, where your goal is to earn 310 points by making strategic purchases over the course of 10 days. Each day, you'll start with a set amount of money and face a randomly stocked shop full of various items to purchase. Every item offers a unique point value, but your funds are limited, so choose wisely!

### How to Play

1. **Start with cash**: You begin each day with some money in your account.
2. **Shop for items**: The shop will offer a random assortment of items each day.
3. **Purchase and earn points**: You can choose items to purchase based on what you can afford and how many items are left in stock. Each purchase adds points to your score.
4. **Daily progress**: At the end of each day, your current points and remaining cash will be displayed.
5. **Reach your goal**: By the end of the 10th day, you need to have earned at least 310 points to win. If you succeed, you'll receive a winner message. If not, a message will let you know you didn't meet the goal.

### Features

- **Randomized shop items**: The shop's inventory is different every day, offering a new challenge each round.
- **Strategic purchases**: Decide which items to buy based on their cost and point value, while managing your budget.
- **Win or lose**: Your goal is to earn 310 points before the shop closes after 10 days. Can you reach the target?
