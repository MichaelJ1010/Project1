After running the code, the user will start off with some money in their account. The shop will have a randomized assortment of items to purchase. 
The user is then able to choose which items they would like to purchase, which gets stored in a list. 
When the user is finished, the program will calculate how much the user owes and if they can afford it. 
The shop will then go to the next day and add some more money to the account if it's a weekday (user doesn't work on the weekends).
