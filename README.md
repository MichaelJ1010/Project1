# Shop Game

## Author: Michael Johnson

### Overview

Welcome to **Shop Game**, where your goal is to earn 310 points by making strategic purchases over the course of 10 days. Each dollar you spend in the shop equates to one point. Each day, you'll start with a set amount of money and face a randomly stocked shop full of various items to purchase. 

### How to Play

1. **Start with cash**: You will start out with some money, and earn some more after every weekday.
2. **Shop for items**: The shop will offer a random assortment of items each day with random prices.
3. **Purchase and earn points**: You can choose items to purchase based on what you can afford and how many items are left in stock.
4. **Daily progress**: At the end of each day, your current points and remaining cash will be displayed.
5. **Reach your goal**: By the end of the 10th day, you need to have earned at least 310 points to win. If you succeed, you'll receive a winner message. If not, a message will let you know you didn't meet the goal.

### Features

- **Randomized shop items**: The shop's inventory is different every day, offering a unique shopping experience.
- **Strategic purchases**: Decide which items to buy based on their cost and point value, while managing your budget.
- **Win or lose**: Your goal is to earn 310 points before the shop closes after 10 days.
